#  AstroImage

## Prerequisites

* Xcode 13.4.1 (13F100)
* Swift 5.6.1 
* iOS 15

## API

I'm using an API provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) named [APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)](https://api.nasa.gov/). This API can be used to retrive the current and historic astronomy pictures. 

On NASA's API documentation it states:

> One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
